Only turns out he worked as a model years ago in Bangladesh. Now an owner of a restaurant in Brick Lane, I met him plying his trade outside the Old Truman&rsquo;s Brewery, Hanbury Street, on Saturday night. Actually he was nominated by his friend on the other side of the road, but was happy to be daily portrait #153.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d got stuck in Brick Lane, having emerged from the Free Range photography degree shows and talks to find it properly chucking it down. Jeans, sandals and a leather jacket are not ideal for wet-weather cycling.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you can avoid the actual downpours, there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for wet-weather photography. I like the muted tones it&rsquo;s brought to this portrait, and the way the soft background smudges the details of the puddly grey street like an impressionist painting.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jay seemed a bit of a natural, striking some professional poses as I was making his portrait, and I asked him about it.
