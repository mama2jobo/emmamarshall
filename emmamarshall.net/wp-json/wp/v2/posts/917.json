Not particularly surprising, seeing as he runs a pub in my local area.&nbsp;I enlisted him as my daily portrait and we went into the garden as the light was fading fast.<\/p>\n<p>David was full of energy and wouldn&rsquo;t stay still for long enough for me to get the photo I wanted, and this was exacerbated by the fact that we had a bit of an audience.<\/p>\n<p>This was the only frame in which he was both standing still (so not blurred), and looking at the camera without a trace of self consciousness. I love his expression, which seems at the same time frank, honest and disarmed. Like we&rsquo;re really seeing him, but he&rsquo;s really seeing us too.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So David was actually my portrait of last week, but I&rsquo;m a bit behind and wanted to feature him, so here he is.
